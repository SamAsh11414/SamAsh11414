### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Samuel Ashkenas, I am a "Full Stack Developer" but thats slightly stretching the definition. I live in New York City and go to Brooklyn Technical High School. As of writing this I am 14 as of writing this and will be until April 10th. I know: Python, C#, Javascript, CSS. I hope to learn more in the future and so I can start to work on more serious project that may effect the world.
